Overview: 
Epiworld is an Agent Based coding package developed with the sole purpose of simulating infectious diseases 
as they spread through populations. The user is able to specify certain parameters in order to
replicate real-world conditions such as initial population size, vaccination rates, hospitalization 
rates, schools as entities, and of course, the disease of interest. Epiworld contains several 
epidemiological models in which the user may select to run such a simulation. These models include:
SIR, SIRConnected, SIS, SEIR, SEIRConnected, and Surveillance.
