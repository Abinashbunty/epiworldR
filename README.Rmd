# epiworldR 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This R package is a wrapper of the C++ library [epiworld](https://github.com/UofUEpi/epiworld). 
It provides a general framework for modeling disease transmission using Agent-Based Models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of epiworldR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UofUEpi/epiworldR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(epiworldR)

# Creating a SIR model
sir <- ModelSIR(
  name           = "COVID-19",
  prevalence     = .01,
  infectiousness = .9,
  recovery       = .3
  )

# Adding a Small world population 
agents_smallworld(
  sir,
  n = 100000,
  k = 10,
  d = FALSE,
  p = .01
  )


# Running and printing
queuing_off(sir)
run(sir, ndays = 100, seed = 1912)
sir
```

Visualizing the outputs

```{r}
plot(sir)
```
