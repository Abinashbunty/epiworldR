Description: A flexible framework for Agent-Based Models (ABM), the epiworldR 
    package provides methods for prototyping disease outbreaks and transmission 
    models using a C++ backend, making it very fast. It supports multiple 
    epidemiological models, including the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible 
    (SIS), Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR), 
    Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR), and others, involving 
    arbitrary mitigation policies and multiple-disease models. Users can 
    specify infectiousness/susceptibility rates as a function of agentsâ€™ 
    features, providing great complexity for the model dynamics. Furthermore, 
    epiworldR is ideal for simulation studies featuring large populations.
